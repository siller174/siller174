### ✨ Highlight: **Cute Framework** – End-to-End Testing for Microservices
I am the **maintainer** of the [Cute framework](https://github.com/ozontech/cute), an open-source, high-performance framework designed for end-to-end distributed system testing. 

Cute makes it simple to perform:
- **End-to-end testing** across multiple services.
- **Asynchronous and distributed workflows** validation.

The framework is used by several companies across Europe and beyond, improving testing reliability and scaling in production environments.
